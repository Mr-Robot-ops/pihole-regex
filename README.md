## Regex Filters for Pi-hole
This is a custom regex filter file for use with Pi-hole v4+ (FTLDNS).

All commands will need to be entered via Terminal (PuTTY or your SSH client of choice) after logging in.

### Why use the installer?
The installer will determine whether you are using the Pi-hole database or the older style regex.list, then evaluate your current regular expressions and act accordingly. It has been created to make life easier.

#### Installer Requirements
This script requires [**Python 3.6+**](https://github.com/mmotti/pihole-regex/issues/16) in order to run correctly. It has been written and tested for Raspbian Buster and Ubuntu Server.

#### Why is root (sudo) required by the installer?
At the time of the scripts creation, it is necessary to run as root in order to modify files in `/etc/pihole` (`regex.list` and `gravity.db`)

#### Can I use these regexps without using the installer?
Yes, you can. You can enter them one by one in the Pi-hole web interface.

### [OPTIONAL] Back up your existing regex list

If you are using the new **Pi-hole DB**
```
sudo cp /etc/pihole/gravity.db /etc/pihole/gravity.db.bak
```

If you are using the older style **regex.list**:
```
sudo cp /etc/pihole/regex.list /etc/pihole/regex.list.bak
```

### Installation
```
curl -sSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-robot-ops/pihole-regex/master/install.py | sudo python3
```

#### Keeping regexps up-to-date
The following instructions will create a cron job to run each morning at 02:45 (adjust the time to suit your needs):

1. Edit the root user's crontab (`sudo crontab -u root -e`)

2. Enter the following:
```
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
45 2 * * * /usr/bin/curl -sSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-robot-ops/pihole-regex/master/install.py | /usr/bin/python3
```
3. Save changes

### Removal
```
curl -sSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-robot-ops/pihole-regex/master/install.py | sudo python3
```

#### Removing the cron job (if you created one)
If this script is the only thing you've added to the root user's crontab, you can run:

`sudo crontab -u root -r`

Otherwise, run:

`sudo crontab -u root -e` and remove the three lines listed above in the install instructions.
